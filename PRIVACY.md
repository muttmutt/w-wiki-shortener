# Privacy Policy for w.wiki Shortener

_Last updated: 2025-09-11_

## Introduction
The **w.wiki Shortener** browser extension (“the Extension”) is developed and published by [Your Name/Organization] (“we,” “our,” or “us”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy describes how the Extension handles information.

## Information Collection
The Extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing data.  

Specifically:
- The Extension does not collect user identifiers, names, email addresses, or any other personal data.  
- The Extension does not track user activity across websites.  
- The Extension does not include advertising, analytics, or third-party tracking scripts.  

## Information Use
The Extension communicates only with the official **Wikimedia Foundation URL Shortener API** at `https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/api.php`. This communication is limited to sending Wikimedia project URLs (e.g., Wikipedia pages) in order to generate a shortened **w.wiki** link.  

The Extension does not use this information for any purpose other than generating the shortened URL, and no data is retained.

## Permissions
The Extension requires certain Chrome permissions to function:

- **activeTab**: to read the URL of the current Wikimedia tab for shortening.  
- **clipboardWrite**: to copy the generated short URL to the user’s clipboard.  
- **contextMenus**: to add a right-click menu for shortening links.  
- **notifications**: to display a simple “Copied” confirmation.  
- **scripting**: used only for a clipboard fallback when direct access is unavailable.  
- **host permissions**: limited to `https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/api.php` for calling the Wikimedia URL Shortener API.  
- **storage**: reserved for optional future settings; no data is stored at this time.  

These permissions are used solely for the stated functionality and not for any tracking or profiling.

## Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any information to third parties. No information is shared with the developer or any external services beyond the official Wikimedia API request described above.

## Security
As the Extension does not collect or store user data, there is no user information at risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse.

## Changes to This Policy
If changes are made to this Privacy Policy, the updated version will be published in the project repository and the Chrome Web Store listing.
